                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to create web pages. It uses tags
                    to structure and format content, defining headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Elements
                    are enclosed in angle brackets, often with opening and closing tags. HTML5 introduced semantic tags
                    for better structure. Combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, HTML enables
                    developers to design visually appealing and interactive websites. Browsers interpret HTML documents
                    to display content to users, making the Internet a dynamic and information-rich platform. HTML's
                    versatility and widespread use have made it a vital skill for web developers and content creators.

                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style language used in web development to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows developers to define colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual elements, separating the content from its presentation. CSS enables consistent styling across multiple pages, making it easier to maintain and update the appearance of a website. Selectors target specific HTML elements to apply styles, and rules can be cascaded or overridden to create desired effects. With CSS, web designers can achieve attractive and responsive designs, enhancing the user experience and improving the overall aesthetics of web pages.
